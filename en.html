              <p>
                I am Emma Savela, a Master's degree student of architecture from the School of Arts, Design and Architecture and an experienced student active. This past year as a member of AYY’s board has taught me what it is to work together for the best student’s life in the world. This is the work I want to continue and thus I am applying to become the Former of AYY’s Board in 2019.

              <p>
                As a leader I am fair, supportive and approachable. The most valuable thing for me is to work together with people and the opportunity to let every team member shine in what they do best. People-centered leadership, listening, active presence and genuine encounters are best learned through experiences. My major leadership learning experience has been the chairmanship of the Guild of Architecture in 2017. One of the greatest successes of that year was to get a very diverse group of people in the board to work as a team while keeping our tasks meaningful, inspiring and fun for everyone.

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">
              <p>
                I am really passionate about our Student Union and I believe that I could lead AYY forward with a determined, enthusiastic and courageous approach. I am not afraid to face new challenges and I am capable of controlling large and comprehensive projects. I am easy to work with and I am great at sharing my enthusiasm with others, thus provoking future actives and leaders and generating continuity.

              <h6>A year of working together</h6>
              <p>
                In 2019, the major recruitments of a new CFO and Secretary General provide an excellent opportunity to review AYY’s practices and processes in a new way. The newly approved policy paper and strategy give us a firm direction, and new strategic priorities, such as environmental leadership, will bring changes to AYY’s actions. Next year it will be as crucial as ever to get both the Board and the entire office to achieve common goals by doing things together. It is important for me to motivate people to work together as a team in which everyone’s needs, aspirations and individuality are taken into account.
              </p>
              <h6>A year of the community</h6>
              <p>
                A lot will happen in our community in 2019. The results of the community structure project will be clear, and the plans of the Student Center will proceed. This past year, the Student Center’s visionary work has revealed a clear need for a common living room for all Aalto people, an open meeting place for everyone. As the project progresses, it requires sufficient resources without forgetting the student perspective. The Aalto community and all its different cultures are a huge asset, which gives everyone a chance to learn and grow as a human being. My dream is to see an Aalto community where everyone feels at home and is accepted into the Aalto family as they are. By openly listening and discussing, I would be the best person to contribute to the development of the community towards inclusion and openness.
              </p>
              <h6>Developing housing together with students</h6>
              <p>
                AYY's real estate strategy has ambitious goals to increase housing opportunities from 3000 to 4000 spots by 2026. In the coming year, before planning the apartments in Otakaari, the principles of building student housing in AYY should be examined together with students. Student housing and its recreational facilities should meet the needs of students and encourage a sense of community. AYY’s aparments should not be just rooms, but actual student homes. Through the construction of new student housing, AYY also gets the opportunity to be a leader in Otaniemi's campus development. Thanks to my current sector, I have both the courage to try new things and the necessary experience in housing and real estate issues. In addition to these features, sufficient resources are necessary in order to achieve these ambitious goals.
